# Social Training

This repository contains the code for the social-training Master's research project. The project's goal was using multiple machine learning classifiers for semi-supervised learning classification tasks. The results of these multiple classifications are then aggregated through the use of social choice functions.

For that, Python 3 was used alongside the Scikit-learn library. Also, for the social choice functions, the ballot-box (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ballotbox/0.1) library was adapted.

I do not own ballot-box code but needed to add it internally to the project in order to make it work in Python 3. I intend to fork it properly and add my changes to Pypi in the future.
